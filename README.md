 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of my **InternPe Internship**.  
The goal of the project is to predict whether a person has diabetes based on certain health parameters.

ðŸ”¹ Project Description
- Implemented using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**.
- Trained multiple Machine Learning models and evaluated their performance.
- Final model predicts diabetes with good accuracy.

 ðŸ”¹ Dataset
- The dataset used is the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset** (commonly available on Kaggle/UCI repository).
- Features include: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Age, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Steps Covered
1. Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries
- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

ðŸ”¹ Results
- The best performing model achieved **90% accuracy** in predicting diabetes.
